<P>Attn: Sir/Madam,<BR><BR>I am contacting you with a keen interest to cons=
ider a possible collaboration through investments in viable projects in you=

United States.<BR><BR>I am solely responsible for investing a client's fund=
s through a diversified investment strategy, targeting positive capital ret=
urns through a global expansive portfolio.<BR><BR>
Although, my client's initial interest was to invest in the United Arab Emi=
rates and Qatar economy, as he is originally from that region, specifically=
 from the Saudi Arabia, but because of his embattled political background i=
n his home country of Saudi Arabia, he decided to export his investment out=
side The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, hence his interest to seek =
possible collaboration with a capable private individual or firm globally.<=
BR><BR>
His plan is to focus more on U.S. and Canadian markets as well as emerging =
markets in Europe, Brazil, Mexico, China, Japan, Bahamas, and Indonesia (et=
c).<BR><BR>He intends to invest in areas of agriculture, mining, manufactur=
ing, construction, Real estates, trading etc. He is ready to invest in proj=
ect developments and business ventures that can generate at least 3% Annual=
 Return on Investment (ROI).<BR><BR>
He will be willing to go on an Investment/Loan Funding Program with you in =
any viable project initiative within your scope of funding. If interested p=
lease write to me directly for possible business collaboration and further =
details.<BR><BR>I am looking forward to hearing from you <BR><BR>Yours Sinc=
erely,<BR>Mr. Leonard Bernstein</P></BODY></HTML>
